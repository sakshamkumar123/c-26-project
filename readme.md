1 3/4 cups all purpose flour, or (plain flour), (8 oz | 227 g) 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, (2.6 oz | 75 g) or regular Hershey's cocoa powder 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, (or bi-carb soda) 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups white granulated sugar, (14 oz | 410 g) 2 large eggs 1 cup milk, (250 ml) 1/2 cup vegetable oil, (125 ml) 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup boiling water (250 ml)


Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C) standard or 320째F (160째C) fan/convection. Lightly grease 2x 9-inch (22cm) round cake pans with butter. Line base with parchment paper. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Whisk in sugar, then add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free, about 30 seconds. Pour boiling water into batter, mixing well. Cake batter is thin in consistency. Pour batter into cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely before frosting.
